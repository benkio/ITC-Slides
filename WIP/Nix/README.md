# Ideas to add

- Unison scalar inspiration
- flakes
- delete old generations story
- cons: extra layer of complexity (eg, custom work GPG key to sign commits story)
- cons: not all the software is available for all the platforms, especially `darwin-nix`
- If you set up your channels wrong you are screwed
- chatGPT for the rescue
- Add Git Guardian to check for secrets and use PRs
- (Optional) `update` command to make the changes easier
